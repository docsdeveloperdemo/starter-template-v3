## ⚠️ Warning and Disclaimer

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

The keyboard automation tools and scripts provided in this documentation are intended for educational and productivity purposes only. By using these tools, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

### Important Warnings

- **Codespace Environment Impact**: Keyboard automation can interact with your codespace environment and applications in ways that may cause unexpected behavior, data loss, or environment instability.
- **Security Considerations**: Automated keyboard inputs may inadvertently trigger security features, access sensitive information, or interact with applications in unintended ways within your codespace.
- **Application Compatibility**: Not all applications handle automated input the same way. Some may block or misinterpret automated keystrokes within the codespace environment.
- **Rate Limiting**: Rapid automated inputs may trigger rate limiting, security measures, or cause applications to become unresponsive within your codespace.
- **Environment Isolation**: While codespaces provide isolation, automated inputs can still affect your workspace, files, and running processes within the container.

### Disclaimer of Liability

The developers and maintainers of this keyboard automation system:

- Provide this software "AS IS" without warranty of any kind, either express or implied
- Are not responsible for any damage, data loss, security breaches, or other issues that may arise from use of these tools
- Do not guarantee compatibility with all codespace configurations, applications, or use cases
- Are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages

### User Responsibilities

By using these tools, you agree to:

- Test thoroughly in safe environments before production use
- Understand the implications of automated keyboard input in your specific codespace context
- Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and terms of service
- Use these tools ethically and responsibly
- Take full responsibility for any consequences of their use
- Ensure your codespace usage complies with your hosting provider's terms of service

### Ethical Use

These tools should only be used for legitimate purposes such as:
- Personal productivity automation
- Testing and development
- Educational purposes
- Authorized system administration tasks within your codespace

**Do not use these tools for:**
- Unauthorized access to systems or data
- Circumventing security measures
- Violating terms of service
- Any illegal or unethical activities
